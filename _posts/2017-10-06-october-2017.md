Welcome to the release version 1.0 of Flyve MDM Inventory Library for Android!

We are proud to introduce you the Inventory Library for Android which helps you to create a complete inventory of your Android devices where both hardware and software informations are collected. You get the data about processor, memory, drives, sensors, and [more](#the-specifications), also the list and description of installed applications on any device in a beautiful XML as protocol compatible with Fusion Inventory for GLPI.

Here we present you the most important characteristics of the Inventory Library.

### Brand new library

We created the library from the Fusion Inventory Agent following the [inventory protocol](http://fusioninventory.org/documentation/dev/spec/protocol/inventory.html "More information of Fusion Inventory") the library, written in Java for developing applications on Android, contains new specifications in order to offer an improved performance to our users.

### Easy Implementation

We designed the library with an easy implementation in order to facilitate its use in your code, as you can see in the following example:

```java
InventoryTask inventoryTask = new InventoryTask(MainActivity.this, "Agent_v1.0", new InventoryTask.OnTaskCompleted() {
  @Override
  public void onTaskCompleted(String data) {
    Log.d("XML", data);
  }
});

inventoryTask.execute();
```
It requires Android 1.6 or API 10 at least for work.

### Continuos Integration

The development of this library was made with the latest technologies in continuos integration, we included Circle CI to our project in order to verify that the changes and new functionalities of the code do not affect the status of the software, maintaining a quality control.
